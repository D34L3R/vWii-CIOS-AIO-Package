Warning!!! This cIOS install AIO is for the Wii U's vWii only. Attempting to use it in a standard Wii could brick it.

I do not own any of the programs, files, or tutorials in this AIO package. I simply created the AIO so you do not have to
hunt everything down. 

Requirements: Your Wii U must already have The Homebrew Launcher (I am unsure if you need Haxchi, but I used it)

Tutorial: https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/vwii-modding

All programs, files, apps, and everything else in this AIO belongs to their respective creators.

When copying the files to your SD, remember to not copy the readme. Copy all files to the root
